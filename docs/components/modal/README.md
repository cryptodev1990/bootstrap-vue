# Modals

>  Modals are streamlined, but flexible dialog prompts powered by JavaScript.
  They support a number of use cases from user notification to completely custom content and feature
  a handful of helpful sub-components, sizes, and more.

Other elements can easily show modals using `v-b-modal` directive.

```html
    <!-- Using modifiers --> 
    <b-btn v-b-modal.modal1>Show Modal</b-btn>
    
    <!-- Using value --> 
    <b-btn v-b-modal="'modal1'">Show Modal</b-btn>
```
